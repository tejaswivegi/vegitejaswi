# REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
This process is adopted when management of the system development, Personnel decide that the particular system needs improvement.

The system development life cycle is the set of activities, carried out by the analyst, designers and users to develop and implement a system.

The systems that are present in the nature follow common life cycle pattern. For example consider the raining system.

Initially the rain falls into the river, river flows into sea, the sea water evaporates to form vapors, the vapors form clouds which again bring rain.

Similarly consider a man made system initially a system is analyzed, designed and made operational by the efforts of system analysis.

After successful operation or a number of users, the system becomes less and less effective by change in the environment.

So these changes have to be incorporated in to the system by minor modifications. So the general activities from the life cycle of the system are given below:

Selection ion and identification of the system to be studied

Preliminary study


• Defining the system • Design and development of the system
• Implementation of the system
