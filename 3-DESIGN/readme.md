The game environment is a 30030 map. The snake starts with length one.

Then we began with the design phase of the system. System design is a solution, a “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system.

It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational.

It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers.

For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation

Here we use Flowchart to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.

It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.

START
enter the main menu of snake game Enter your choice ?

Enter name Play game quit Do you want to continue?

STOP
At each time step the snake moves one step, and it can go straight, turn left, or turn right

The snake hits its own body or the wall, The length of the snake gets zero, The game score gets negative.

The Main aim of the game is to collect the dots(Food) and avoid the obstacles (boarders, crosses, and the snake itself).

As you collect the food, the snake gets longer , so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself.

when you collected enough food, you progress into the next level, where your snake gets larger.
